# Todos

## Link

Neaten linking library
allow to actually link to files now
add "main()" and "onconnect()"

## Server

change the server routing rules to make more sense somehow.  Probably with the objects themselves containing route handling.  Allow for more complex route handling and allow routehandlers to cover the same area.

## ExternHandler

Add caching extern handler which can be extended

## Permissions

Re-add a permission system.
